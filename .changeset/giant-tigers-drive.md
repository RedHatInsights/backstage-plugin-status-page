This update enhances the **Audit Access Manager** and **Compliance Hub** experience through functional and usability improvements:

1. Added the **Compliance Manager (CM)** tab within the **Compliance Hub** page and fixed the *View Details* functionality for CM records.  
2. Introduced support for additional **Jira states** (“Done” and “Complete”) to ensure more accurate workflow tracking and synchronization.  
3. Refined **banner display logic** to improve clarity, ensuring accurate visibility of review and rejection states.
